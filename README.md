# Project6_Loan_Approval_Prediction
To create a ML model to identify the customers segments, those who are eligible for loan amount so that these customers can be  these can specifically targeted. 

Introduction:
Dream Housing Finance company deals in all home loans. They have presence across all urban, semi urban and rural areas. Customer first apply for home loan after that company validates the customer eligibility for loan.

These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers. Here they have provided a partial data set.

Dataset Description:
1. Loan_ID: Unique Loan ID 
2. Gender: Male/ Female 
3. Married: Applicant married (Y/N) 
4. Dependents: Number of dependents 
5. Education: Applicant Education (Graduate/ Under Graduate)

11. Credit_History: Credit history meets guidelines 
12. Property_Area: Urban/ Semi Urban/ 
13. Rural Loan_Status: Loan approved (Y/N)

Libraries Involved:

1. Numpy 
2. Pandas 
3. Seaborn 
4. Matplotlib 
5. Graphviz 
6. LogisticRegression 
7. DecisionTreeClassifier 
8. RandomForestClassifier


Steps Involved:

1. Load the Loan Approval Dataset
2. Data Analysis
3. Preprocessing Data
4. Modeling


Conclusion:

Logistic Regression Confusion matrix is very similar to Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier. In this analysis, we did extensive analysis of input data and were able to achieve Test Accuracy of 86 %
